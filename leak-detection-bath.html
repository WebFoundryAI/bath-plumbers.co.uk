                <h2>Professional Leak Detection Services</h2>
                <p>Hidden leaks can cause extensive damage to Bath's period properties before they are discovered. Damp patches, increased water bills, or the sound of running water when nothing is on all indicate a potential hidden leak. Bath Plumbers provides professional leak detection across Bath and North East Somerset, using specialist equipment to pinpoint leaks accurately without unnecessary excavation or damage to your property.</p>
                <p>In Bath's Georgian and Victorian buildings, pipework is often concealed within thick walls or beneath solid floors. Our non-invasive detection methods allow us to locate leaks with precision, meaning repairs can be targeted and minimal disruption to original features.</p>

                <h2>Signs You May Have a Hidden Leak</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unexplained increase in water bills</li>
                    <li>Damp patches on walls or ceilings</li>
                    <li>Sound of running water when all taps are off</li>
                    <li>Water meter spinning when no water is being used</li>
                    <li>Mould or mildew appearing</li>
                    <li>Warm spots on floors (possible underfloor heating leak)</li>
                    <li>Low water pressure</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Our Detection Methods</h2>
                <p>We use a range of professional detection equipment to locate leaks accurately:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Acoustic detection</strong> - Listening devices that amplify the sound of water escaping from pipes</li>
                    <li><strong>Thermal imaging</strong> - Cameras that detect temperature differences caused by leaks</li>
                    <li><strong>Tracer gas</strong> - Non-toxic gas introduced to pipework that can be detected through surfaces</li>
                    <li><strong>Moisture mapping</strong> - Identifying the extent of water damage and tracking to source</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why Early Detection Matters</h2>
                <p>In period properties, hidden leaks can cause serious problems including damage to original plasterwork, timber rot, and structural issues. Early detection and repair prevents minor leaks becoming major damage. It also stops wasted water and the associated costs on your bills.</p>
