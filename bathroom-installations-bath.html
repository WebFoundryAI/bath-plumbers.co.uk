                <p>In a city famous for its Roman Baths, it seems fitting that we take bathroom design and installation seriously. We work with your ideas and requirements to create spaces that combine practicality with aesthetics, using quality materials and fixtures that will look great and last for years.</p>

                <h2>Period Property Expertise</h2>
                <p>Installing bathrooms in Bath's historic properties requires particular care and expertise. Georgian and Victorian buildings often have solid stone walls, uneven floors, and limited space. We have extensive experience working in listed buildings and conservation areas, understanding how to install modern plumbing systems whilst respecting original architectural features.</p>

                <p>We can advise on appropriate styles that complement period aesthetics, from traditional Victorian roll-top baths to discreet modern fixtures that do not detract from original character. We also navigate the practical challenges of routing pipework, ensuring adequate ventilation, and working within the constraints of older buildings.</p>

                <h2>Complete Project Management</h2>
                <p>Our bathroom installation service covers all aspects of the project:</p>
