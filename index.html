                <h2>Understanding Bath's Historic Properties</h2>
                <p>Bath's World Heritage status reflects the exceptional quality of its Georgian architecture. Working on these properties requires more than standard plumbing skills. Our team understands the construction methods, materials, and design features unique to Bath's historic buildings.</p>
                <p>Period properties often feature original lead pipework, cast iron soil stacks, and ceramic sanitary ware that require specialist knowledge to maintain and repair. Modern plumbing installations must be carried out sensitively, often requiring coordination with conservation officers for listed building consent. We have established relationships with Bath and North East Somerset Council and understand the planning requirements for work on historic buildings.</p>
                <p>From concealed leak repairs that minimise disruption to period features, to bathroom renovations that respect original character, we approach every job with care for your property's heritage.</p>
